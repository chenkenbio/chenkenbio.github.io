# Ken Chen (陈恳)  

I am a Ph.D. student at Sun Yat-sen University. My research interests primarily focus on computational biology, including but not limited to utilizing various computatioal methods to deepen our understanding of the effect of genomic variants. Additionally, I am also working on sequence-based modeling of 3D genome, gene regulation and RNA modification.
